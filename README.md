# Table Piano Project

Welcome to the Table Piano Project, an interactive and educational piano experience using an ultrasonic sensor, Arduino, and a P5js interface.

## [Link To P5js Interface](https://editor.p5js.org/mt4610/sketches/qagePD-k9)


## Overview

I created a table piano with three exciting modes:

1. **Free Mode:** Explore your creativity by playing the piano at your own pace. Each note triggers a unique image on the P5js interface, providing an immersive and enjoyable experience.

2. **Record Mode:** Record and store each key played, allowing you to create and playback your tunes. A perfect tool for precision and improvement.

3. **Game Mode:** Challenge yourself with falling numbers that correspond to piano keys. Press the right key at the right time, and as your score increases, the game gets faster and more challenging. A fun way to build muscle memory and reflexes.

## Features

- Ultrasonic sensor and Arduino integration for accurate note detection.
- P5js interface for a visual and interactive piano experience.
- Modes for creative play, recording tunes, and a challenging game.
- Score tracking and high score display in the game mode.

## Getting Started

1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to your Arduino setup.
2. Upload the Arduino code to handle ultrasonic sensor data.
3. Run the P5js interface to start exploring the different modes.
4. Choose between Free, Record, or Game mode to experience the variety of features.

## Arduino Setup

1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the designated pins on your Arduino board.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code (`finalProject.ino`) to handle sensor data.
3. Ensure a stable connection between Arduino and the ultrasonic sensor.
